Hello, guys. Short video about Magnus cow's statement. What I am thinking I want to say just a couple words. I finally changed my mind and I fully agree with every word. What Magnus said it's really hard, hard to play with people who already had cheated on the chat, even if it's online or offline. What I want to say he didn't say all the information, what he have. I think because he knows something more. Maybe he just catch him on the Twitter or something like that, I don't know. No one knows. But it's still not over about this situation. And very logical question what next? So we don't have any proofs, we just have world champion opinions don't want to master. But no one cannot prove it he was cheater or no. What I'm thinking I don't know actually I want to say like we cannot just stop him to play chess. Yes, because maybe and St. Louis, who knows? So you'll be more and more and more. What do you think, guys?
